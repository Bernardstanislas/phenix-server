One common challenge web developers face is achieving equal height columns, where multiple columns appear to be the same height regardless of the content within them. In this tutorial, we&#39;ll explore how to create same height columns using CSS, ensuring your website&#39;s design remains consistent and polished.<\/p>\n<h3>The Flexbox Approach<\/h3>\n<p>Flexbox, short for Flexible Box Layout, is a powerful CSS layout model that simplifies the process of creating flexible and responsive designs. It&#39;s a perfect solution for achieving equal height columns.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#39;s how you can use Flexbox to create same height columns:<\/p>\n<div class=\"examples\">\n<div class=\"topic\">CSS<\/div>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.container {\r\n  display: flex;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.column {\r\n  flex: 1;\r\n  margin: 0 10px;\r\n}\r\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"examples\">\n<div class=\"topic\">Result<\/div>\n<style>\n.container {\n  display: flex;\n}\n.column {\n  flex: 1;\n  margin: 0 10px;\n  border: 2px solid blue;\n  padding: 5px;\n}<\/style>\n<div class=\"container\">\n<div class=\"column\">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry&#8217;s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,\n  <\/div>\n<div class=\"column\">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry&#8217;s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry&#8217;s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,\n  <\/div>\n<div class=\"column\">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry&#8217;s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,\n  <\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>In this example, we have a container element that will hold our columns. By setting <code>display: flex;<\/code> on the container, we enable the Flexbox layout. The <code>flex: 1;<\/code> property on each column ensures that they all grow to occupy an equal amount of available space, creating the same height effect. The <code>margin<\/code> is added to provide some spacing between the columns.<\/p>\n<h3>The Grid Approach<\/h3>\n<p>CSS Grid Layout is another modern layout system that provides a powerful way to design both simple and complex layouts. It can also be used to achieve equal height columns:<\/p>\n<div class=\"examples\">\n<div class=\"topic\">CSS<\/div>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.container {\r\n  display: grid;\r\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(250px, 1fr));\r\n  gap: 20px;\r\n}\r\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"examples\">\n<div class=\"topic\">Result<\/div>\n<style>\n.containerg {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(250px, 1fr));\n  gap: 20px;\n}\n.columng {\n  border: 2px solid green;\n  padding: 10px;\n}\n<\/style>\n<div class=\"containerg\">\n<div class=\"columng\">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry&#8217;s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,\n  <\/div>\n<div class=\"columng\">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry&#8217;s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry&#8217;s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,\n  <\/div>\n<div class=\"columng\">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry&#8217;s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,\n  <\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>In this example, the <code>display: grid;<\/code> property is applied to the container, indicating that we want to use the CSS Grid layout. The <code>grid-template-columns<\/code> property specifies the column layout. The <code>repeat(auto-fill, minmax(250px, 1fr))<\/code> part ensures that columns will be automatically created with a minimum width of 250px and expand to fill the available space equally. The <code>gap<\/code> property adds spacing between the columns.<\/p>\n<h3>The Table Approach<\/h3>\n<p>While not as commonly used for layout as Flexbox or CSS Grid, the table display property can also achieve equal height columns:<\/p>\n<div class=\"examples\">\n<div class=\"topic\">CSS<\/div>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.container {\r\n  display: table;\r\n  width: 100%;\r\n  table-layout: fixed;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.column {\r\n  display: table-cell;\r\n  padding: 10px;\r\n}\r\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"examples\">\n<div class=\"topic\">Result<\/div>\n<style>\n.containert {\n  display: table;\n  width: 100%;\n  table-layout: fixed;\n}\n.columnt {\n  display: table-cell;\n  padding: 10px;\n  border: 2px solid red;\n}\n<\/style>\n<div class=\"containert\">\n<div class=\"columnt\">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry&#8217;s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,\n  <\/div>\n<div class=\"columnt\">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry&#8217;s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry&#8217;s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,\n  <\/div>\n<div class=\"columnt\">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry&#8217;s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,\n  <\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>In this approach, the <code>display: table;<\/code> property is applied to the container, and <code>table-layout: fixed;<\/code> ensures that the column widths are determined by the first row of content. The <code>display: table-cell;<\/code> property is used for each column, making them behave like table cells. This method ensures that all columns have the same height based on the content in the row.<\/p>\n<h3>Conclusion<\/h3>\n<p>Creating same height columns is an important aspect of web design to ensure a clean and professional appearance. Whether you choose the Flexbox, CSS Grid, or table approach, each technique provides a way to achieve this effect.
