# Selecting flavor

Picking a suitable flavor can be challenging, considering how many options there are depending on the language you are using.

Below is a simple cheat sheet to help you pick a suitable flavor for your language/tool, based on list of supported languages on regex101.

## Important information

The PCRE libraries are compiled in 16-bit mode to be compatible with your browser and Javascript.

**All flavors run natively in your browser!**
