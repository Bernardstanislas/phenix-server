   - Select users of the website are now be given a Community Moderator role on the website. They will be able to perform these additional elevated actions:

     - Flag entries in the regex library as "recommended". These entries will stand out through a different color, and be ranked higher in search results.

     - Remove and edit library submission

     - They will have a flair in their account page that indicates their status

   - Added more sort methods to the community regex library

6. Improve resilience of application to network issues.

   The app will now behave better in cases where the main server is down by still rendering the offline version in the browser.
   It will also handle cases where the API is taking an excessive amount to load, and falls back to the offline cached version.
   The app will inform you through a popup once loaded if it's running offline or not.

   The NGINX timeout has been reduced and mitigations have been put into place to avoid more server outages.

# 10.0.0 - 12th of June, 2023

From this date forth, all entries saved anonymously on the website will have a lifetime of 1 year,
unless accessed within that time period, which will extend their lifetime by another year.

If an entry has not been accessed for a year, it will be automatically removed, starting from the
date of this release. This does **not** apply to entries saved while signed in or those submitted to the library.

**Note: This is not finalized yet, I will review this over the coming year or two and see how things evolve.**

1. Allow hyphens at the end of character classes in Java [https://github.com/firasdib/Regex101/issues/2080](https://github.com/firasdib/Regex101/issues/2080)

6. Add tooltip to explain why regex debugger is unavailable [https://github.com/firasdib/Regex101/issues/2078#issuecomment-1591256702](https://github.com/firasdib/Regex101/issues/2078#issuecomment-1591256702)

7. Fix typo where in Javascript regex parser was accepting `\p{Script_Extension=...}` instead of `\p{Script_Extensions=...}`

8. Adjust how surrogate pairs are represented in the regular expression [https://github.com/firasdib/Regex101/issues/2082](https://github.com/firasdib/Regex101/issues/2082)

   When the regex is matching in non-unicode mode, the regex box will show the respective code points being matched -- just as the regex engine treats it.
   This means it might look a little bit funky when you're using the UI, but it's the most accurate representation.

   **Example:**

   `/𐌐?/.test('\ud800')` will match, because the actual regex is `/\ud800\udf10?/`, which is not obvious unless the code points are split up.

   In unicode-mode, i.e., `/𐌐?/u.test('\ud800')`, the regex does not match, and the UI will represent the character differently to reflect that.

## Version 5.0.0 - 22th of January, 2021

1. Rewrote entire backend to improve performance

2. Reworked the account page; titles and tags are now associated with the entire
   permalink and not a specific version.

3. Redesigned the save modal, it now shows the account information (if signed in) in the same view,
   and makes it easier to work with.

4. Switched to new icons throughout the entire application

5. Slight modifications to the general look and feel, such as flatter buttons and larger font sizes.

6. Added support for PCRE2

7. Dropped support for legacy browsers, approximately the following versions: Internet Explorer, Firefox <55, Chrome <60, Edge <16

8. Reworked library entries: a permalink is now permanently associated with an account and the
   entry, and the owner can whenever they want update the version of that permalink which will reflect
   in the library. Hopefully this is not going to be abused, but if it is, the library will always
   default to the first version and never allow for an update.

9. Titles and tags are now associated with the entire permalink and all versions within it.

10. The default save functionality of the website has been changed, now a new permalink is created
    by default (using ctrl+s) and an update of the current workspace has to be explicit,
    by either clicking the menu item or using ctrl+shift+s.

11. The regex quiz now utilizes the PCRE2 engine instead of PCRE1.
    Can you exploit this to your advantage?

12. Multiple dependencies has been updated, which has resulted in a lot of behind-the-scenes work.
    This has resulted in general performance improvements, but nothing you are likely to experience.

13. Squashed 20-30 different edge case bugs in the app and regex tokenizer.
    I will outline fixes of this nature in the future, but for now, take my word for it.

14. The supported Python version is now indicated in the sidebar

15. Reorganized settings

16. Added a new setting that allows you to conditionally turn on/off step counting in supported
    flavors. This can dramatically improve performance in complex expressions.

17. Fixed key binding bug which would present itself in the debugger.

18. Added more tests to multiple quiz tasks.

19. Implemented surgical fix to avoid odd tabbing behavior in debugger (and other similar modals)

20. Added support for the # delimiter.

21. Due to 2 and 8, the database had to be modified, and data had to be migrated.
    Some loss of data is to be expected, since not all the information from the previous model could
    fit in the new one, but there are extremely few individuals affected.
    This only affects titles and tags, not any saved expressions.

22. Fixed autoit code generator

23. Fixed parsing and validation of surrogate pairs in the editor

24. Added a "whats new" button to the header

25. Revised contrast of dark theme

26. Increased font sizes slightly

27. Improved performance of tooltips in the editor (and possible squashed a few bugs that would cause the app to crash)

28. Rewrote large parts of the editor page (front page) and the regex parser. Hopefully I have not introduced (too many) new bugs...

29. Substitution area has received some love. A new indicator was added, similar to the match functionality.

30. Added PCRE2 native substitution (and the new syntax).

31. Fixed bug with `\b` in substitution
